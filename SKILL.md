# Forge Standard Review

Quota-free iterative code review that runs entirely in your repository.

> No external service tokens or paid review credentials required - fully offline capable and quota-free.

## Overview

Forge Standard brings a disciplined, repeatable review pass to every change
without quotas, rate limits, or external dependencies. It operates as a
continuous loop with multiple reviewer perspectives, a ranked report, and
per-repo memory that persists across invocations.

Core principles:

- **Quota-free** - no API keys, no usage caps, no network gate.
- **Loop-gated** - iterates up to 8 cycles, at most 4 auto-fix attempts per cycle.
- **Ranked report** - findings ordered critical -> high -> medium -> low -> nitpick.
- **Idempotent memory** - per-repo `.forge-standard-review/` is created once and reused.
- **VCS-aware** - works with git, hg, or no VCS (degrades gracefully).

Use this skill when you need a thorough review before merging, when you want
iterative refinement until the gate passes, or when you want a repeatable
checklist that lives with the repo.

## Install

Global install (recommended):

```bash
npx skills add SriChandraSekharA/forge-standard-review --skill forge-standard-review -g
```

Local project install:

```bash
npx skills add SriChandraSekharA/forge-standard-review --skill forge-standard-review
```

Manual clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SriChandraSekharA/forge-standard-review.git
```

After install the skill is available as `forge-standard-review` via `npx skills add -l`.

## Contract

The skill follows a strict idempotent contract anchored at `.forge-standard-review/`:

1. **First invocation** - `init` creates `.forge-standard-review/` at the repo root
   with baseline config, checklist snapshot, and knowledge fallback manifest.
2. **Reuse thereafter** - every subsequent invocation reads the existing
   `.forge-standard-review/` directory, reuses stored state, and updates only what
   changed (findings, iteration counter, timestamps).
3. **Never recreate blindly** - if `.forge-standard-review/` already exists, scripts
   do not overwrite user customizations; they merge or append.
4. **Per-repo isolation** - each repository owns its own `.forge-standard-review/`
   directory; no global state leaks between repos.
5. **Deterministic cleanup** - `report` consolidates findings without mutating
   source files; `review` may propose patches but requires explicit apply.

This contract guarantees the loop can be re-entered safely any number of times
without duplicating state or losing prior decisions.

## Prerequisites

- **git** - required for diff-range and staged review modes.
- **bash** - required to run scripts (`bash 4+` recommended, `zsh` also works).
- **jq** - optional but recommended for JSON report shaping and filtering.
  If `jq` is absent, reports fall back to plain text tables.

Verify before use:

```bash
git --version
bash --version
jq --version   # optional
```

## Usage

All scripts live under `scripts/` and are executable from the skill root or
via the installed skill path.

### 1. Initialize

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

Creates `.forge-standard-review/` on first run; on later runs validates and
updates the manifest. Safe to run repeatedly.

### 2. Review

```bash
./scripts/review.sh --staged
./scripts/review.sh --range HEAD~1..HEAD
./scripts/review.sh --range main...feature
./scripts/review.sh --file path/to/file.ts
```

Modes:

- `--staged` - review only staged changes (`git diff --cached`).
- `--range <ref>` - review a commit range or branch diff.
- `--file <path>` - review a single file regardless of VCS state.

Options:

- `--max-iterations 8` - cap loop iterations (default 8, alias loop gate 8).
- `--max-fixes 4` - cap auto-fix attempts per iteration (default 4, alias max4).
- `--severity critical,high` - filter report by severity.

### 3. Report

```bash
./scripts/report.sh
./scripts/report.sh --format json
./scripts/report.sh --format markdown --output review.md
```

Generates the ranked report ordered critical -> high -> medium -> low -> nitpick.
No tokens, no external calls, no hidden uploads.

  SKILL.md                # this file - frontmatter + contract
  README.md               # install, features, license
  AGENTS.md               # contributor contract for this repo
  .gitignore              # ignores .forge-standard-review/, logs, caches
  scripts/
    init.sh               # idempotent .forge-standard-review/ bootstrap
    review.sh             # staged | range | file review loop
    report.sh             # ranked report generator
  references/
    checklist.md          # 6-axis checklist (correctness/readability/arch/security/perf/test coverage)
    knowledge.md          # fallback chain priority list

    worker.prompt.md      # worker prompt with 6 axes including test quality

```

- `scripts/` - bash entry points; keep them POSIX-friendly and shellcheck clean.
- `references/` - authoritative checklists and fallback docs.
- `templates/` - output templates consumed by `report.sh`.
- `.forge-standard-review/` - per-repo runtime memory (gitignored, never committed).

## Test-Aware Review

When the target repo has tests, the review loop includes them automatically. Detection is non-failing and uses guards for `tests/` `testsuite/` `__tests__/` `spec/` directories, glob patterns `**/*.test.*` `**/*.spec.*` via `find . -maxdepth 4 -name "*.test.*"`, and config files `pytest.ini` `vitest.config.*` `jest.config.*` `pyproject.toml` pytest `package.json` script test and `Makefile` test - all with `if [ -f ... ]` or `grep -q` guards and `|| true` so review never blocks if none found.

- If tests are detected, `scripts/review.sh` collects (a) list of test files (capped at 20, `find ... | head -20`) and (b) quick discovery with 30s timeout: `timeout 30 pytest --collect-only 2>&1 | head -30 || timeout 30 npm test -- --listTests 2>&1 | head -20 || true` - failure is graceful and does not fail the review.
- `TEST_CONTEXT` is set to `Tests detected: yes` plus file list and discovery output, persisted to `.forge-standard-review/test_context.md` and passed to worker/critic prompts.
- Worker and critic include axis 6 (test quality/coverage): missing tests for changed code, brittle mocks, no edge cases, coverage gaps, test deletion to fake green. Prompt section: "If TEST_CONTEXT shows existing tests, review them for coverage gaps, missing edge cases, brittle mocks, and whether changed code lacks tests."
- Checklist `references/checklist.md` has Test Coverage (Axis 6) with items: changed code has tests? edge cases covered? mocks not brittle? no test deletion to fake green? These map to severity medium/high when missing (missing tests for critical code -> high, typo in test -> low).
- Report `scripts/report.sh` maps test findings to severity and ensures fix/prompt suggests test code: e.g. `add test for changed code: tests/test_foo.py covering boundary and failure cases`.

Example state when tests present:

```bash
cat .forge-standard-review/test_context.md
# Tests detected: yes
# Test files:
# tests/test_foo.py
# tests/test_bar.test.ts
# Discovery:
# tests/test_foo.py::test_boundary
```

Example report snippet mentioning tests:

```
## High

- **src/foo.py | high**
  - reason: missing test coverage for changed code - changed src without test update (Fowler Code Smell)
  - fix: add test for changed code: e.g. tests/test_foo.py covering boundary and failure cases
  - prompt: Act as a senior reviewer, fix high test issue at src/foo.py: missing test coverage ... by add test ...
```

When no tests exist (`Tests detected: no`), the loop skips test checks and does not block - review still passes with exit 0.

## MCP Server

Same-repo server at `mcp/server.ts` with manifest `mcp/mcp.json`, stdio transport via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Mirrors `scripts/review.sh` locally, no network.

### Tool list (synced to `mcp/mcp.json` exactly)

`mcp/mcp.json` declares one tool:

```json
{
  "name": "forge_review",
  "description": "Run forge-standard-review review loop (wraps scripts/review.sh). Supports staged, range, and file modes with ranked report.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "mode": { "type": "string", "enum": ["auto", "staged", "range", "file"], "description": "Review mode: staged (git diff --cached), range (commit range), file (single file), auto (staged else BASE...HEAD)" },
      "range": { "type": "string", "description": "Git range for range mode, e.g. HEAD~1..HEAD or main...feature" },
      "file": { "type": "string", "description": "File path for file mode, e.g. path/to/file.ts" },
      "preview": { "type": "boolean", "description": "If true, only preview the diff without running the loop" },
      "workdir": { "type": "string", "description": "Working directory to run review in (defaults to repo root / current cwd)" }
    },
    "required": []
  }
}
```

Table form:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `mode` | `"auto" \| "staged" \| "range" \| "file"` | Review mode: staged (git diff --cached), range (commit range), file (single file), auto (staged else BASE...HEAD) |
| `range` | `string` | Git range for range mode, e.g. `HEAD~1..HEAD` or `main...feature` |
| `file` | `string` | File path for file mode, e.g. `path/to/file.ts` |
| `preview` | `boolean` | If true, only preview the diff without running the loop |
| `workdir` | `string` | Working directory to run review in (defaults to repo root / current cwd) |

All paths are quoted and `workdir` is passed as `cwd` to `spawn("bash", [...])` with `path.resolve` and `existsSync` validation. No shell interpolation.

### Wiring

- `mcp.json` at `mcp/mcp.json` with `transport: stdio`, `command: node`, `args: ["mcp/dist/server.js"]`, `entry: mcp/src/server.ts`.
- `mcp/src/server.ts` implements `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` for `forge_review`.
- Client config at `examples/claude-config.json` with `mcpServers.forge-standard-review.command = node` and quoted `cwd`.
- Runnable demos: `examples/mcp-client.js` (node) and `examples/stdio-smoke.sh` (bash piped JSON-RPC), both support quoted `--workdir` with spaces.
- Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node mcp/dist/server.js` then verify `tools/list` shows `forge_review`.

## Conventions

- Keep reviews deterministic: same input diff produces same ordered findings.
- Write findings as actionable items with file:line, severity, and fix hint.
- Prefer knowledge fallback chain over hard-coded rules when repo docs exist.
- No network calls inside the loop; all analysis is local.
- Respect `.gitignore` and `.forge-standard-review/` isolation.
